I am a Ph.D. student at Czech Technical University in Prague, supervised by [Dr. Torsten Sattler](https://tsattler.github.io/) and co-advised by [Dr. Pavel Burget](https://testbed-test.ciirc.cvut.cz/people/pavel-burget/). I am also working at Testbed for Industry 4.0, CIIRC as a Graduate researcher.
